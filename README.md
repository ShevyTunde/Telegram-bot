# Telegram-bot
Creating a Telegram bot involves several steps, but I'll provide a basic outline to get you started using Python and the python-telegram-bot library. Make sure you have Python installed on your system before proceeding.

Install the python-telegram-bot library:
You can install the library using pip:
pip install python-telegram-bot
Create a new Telegram bot and get the API token:
You need to create a bot on Telegram and get its API token. To do this, follow these steps:

Open Telegram and search for the "BotFather" bot.
Start a chat with the BotFather and use the /newbot command to create a new bot.
Follow the instructions to choose a name and username for your bot.
Once the bot is created, the BotFather will provide you with an API token. Keep this token safe, as you'll use it to authenticate your bot.
Here's a basic Python script for a Telegram bot that echoes back any message it receives:
basic.py

Run the bot:
Save the Python script and run it using the following command:
 python your_bot_script.py

Your Telegram bot is now running! You can interact with it by searching for the bot username on Telegram and sending it messages. It will echo back whatever message you send to it.

Keep in mind that this is just a basic example to get you started. You can extend the bot's functionality by adding more command handlers and message handlers. For more advanced features, refer to the official python-telegram-bot documentation
